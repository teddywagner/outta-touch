# The Outta Touch Staple Website

## Description

I started this project to redesign the website for the Outta Touch yacht chartering service. I sawe this as an opportunity to dive into a few technologies I have been studying, but have not implemented fully. Leveraging the NextJS 13 framework, I utilized Supabase, Google Cloud, and Vercel to fully bring this project to light. I thoroughly enjoyed building this website during my corporate hiatus.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, run:

```
npm i
npm run gen-types
npm run dev
```

and your application will begin running on `port 3000`.

## Google Cloud Sheets API

From Google Cloud, I utilized the Sheets API to quickly implement a Contact form for the website. I created a service account and copied the credentials file to the root of the project. I then created a `.env.local` file and added the following variables:

```
OOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=
```

This allowed me to use the `google-spreadsheet` package to quickly implement a contact form without the need for a backend. I weighed the use cases for a backend and decided, with the help of my client, that they would access data easier through a Google Sheet.

## Google Cloud CDN

The largest hurdle with this site was implementing the `/gallery` pages. With several hundred photos and videos of content, I needed a CDN to optimally and reliably retrieve images. I used Google Cloud Storage to store the images and videos and then used the Google Cloud CDN. I created a bucket and uploaded the images and videos to the bucket. I then created a load balancer and added the bucket as a backend service.

However, I ran into some performance issues fetching all of the photos in bulk, and needed a solution to store the image metadata in a database to quickly sort and filter the images without fetching large amounts of data.

## Supabase

I used Supabase to store the image metadata. I created a `.env.local` file and added the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

I then created a table called `images` with the following columns:

```
id: integer
folder: text
filename: text
altText: text
favorite: boolean
```

This allowed me to make one fetch request to the database and retrieve all of the image metadata. I then used the `folder` column to filter the images by gallery. I also added a `favorite` column to allow the client to select their favorite images and display them on the home page.

## Vercel

I used Vercel to deploy the website. I followed the instructions to connect my GitHub repository to Vercel and then added the necessary environment variables. I then added the following build commands:

```
npm i
npm run gen-types
npm run build
```
